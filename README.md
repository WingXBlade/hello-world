# hello-world

Hi, I'm a student studying abroad in Japan and goes by the ID of WingXBlade.
I'm currently in my second year of bachelor degree of Computer Science and although I haven't take class for Java development I am currently self teaching myself Java. I have a little experience of C++ and I am interested in JavaScript and Python as well.
